**Apple Pie Project:**  

* Built a word guessing game where each player has 7 turns to guess the letters in a word
* Each incorrect guess results in an apple falling off the tree
* The player wins by guessing the word correctly before all the apples are gone
* The game keeps track of the number of wins and losses
